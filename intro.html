 <h1>what is HTML?</h1>
 <h2>chapter 1</h2>
 <p>The average website includes several different HTML pages. For instance, a home page, an about page, and a contact page would all have separate HTML files.

<p>HTML documents are files that end with a .html or .htm extension. A web browser reads the HTML file and renders its content so that internet users can view it.</p>

<p> All HTML pages have a series of HTML elements, consisting of a set of tags and attributes. HTML elements are the building blocks of a web page. A tag tells the web browser where an element begins and ends, whereas an attribute describes the characteristics of an element.</p>

<p>The three main parts of an element are: 

Opening tag – used to state where an element starts to take effect. The tag is wrapped with opening and closing angle brackets. For example, use the start tag to create a paragraph. 
Content – this is the output that other users see. 
Closing tag – the same as the opening tag, but with a forward slash before the element name. For example,to end a paragraph. </p>
